# HEAL Study Level Metadata

This repository contains the following:

1. A function (`_to_heal_slmd()`) to translate from an MDS record in the HEAL
   Platform to a SLMD instance in JSON format that conforms to the HEAL SLMD
   schema.

2. A Jupyter notebook for examining completeness of the SLMD data for registered
   studies.
